# Data Preprocessing Template

This repository contains a Python script for a basic data preprocessing template. It provides a structured approach to preprocessing data before applying machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

Data preprocessing is an essential step in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. This template covers the following steps:

1. Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are imported to facilitate data manipulation and visualization.

2. Importing Dataset: The dataset is loaded into the script using Pandas' `read_csv` function. This allows for easy access to the data for further processing.

3. Splitting Datasets into Training and Test Set: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

4. Feature Scaling (Optional): Feature scaling is performed to standardize or normalize the features if necessary. This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the model and prevents biases in the learning algorithm.
